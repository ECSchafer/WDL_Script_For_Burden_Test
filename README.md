# WDL_Script_For_Burden_Test
 A WDL script for the complete burden test workflow (OLD AND OUTDATED)

*This is just to showcase some of my code*

This is an older WDL Script that would run the entire rare-variant burden test on synonymous variants using our cases and gnomAD controls. It is tailored towards the Broad Institutes Terra platfrom (Cromwell based).

This is just to showcase my ability to create WDL scripts with multiple pipelined tasks. My lab doesn't use this as much anymore and we have changed the scripts and methods we run. I also use old dockers I created just for this workflow.
